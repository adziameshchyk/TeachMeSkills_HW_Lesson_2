# TeachMeSkills_HW_Lesson_2

>This repository was created for homework in lesson №2.

## Tasks:

- ### *Cycles*
1. Use a for loop to display odd numbers from 1 to 99.  
   When solving, use the increment operator (++).
2. It is necessary to display numbers from 5 to 1 on the screen.  
   When solving, use the decrement (--) operator.
3. Write a program where the user enters any positive integer.  
   And the program sums up all numbers from 1 to the number entered by the user.
4. It is necessary that the program displays the following sequence on the screen:  
   7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70 77 84 91 98.  
   Use a while loop in your solution.
5. Output the first 10 numbers of the sequence 0, -5, -10, -15...
6. Write a program that displays the squares of numbers from 10 to 20 inclusive.

- ### *Control structures*
1. Write a program that displays the name of the season by month number.  
   When solving, use the switch-case statement.
2. Write a program that displays the name of the season by month number.  
   When solving, use the if-else-if statement.
3. Write a program that receives a number on the input and outputs if it's even or not.
4. For the entered number t (outdoor temperature) output:  
           If t>–5, then output "Heat".   
           If –5>= t > –20, then output "Normal".  
           If –20>= t, then output "Cold".  
5. By the entered number, determine the color of the rainbow  
   (1 -red, 4 green, etc.).
   
- ### *Additional tasks*
1. Display the first 11 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
2. For each month the bank accrues 7% of the amount of the deposit.  
   Write a program in which the user enters the initial deposit amount and the number of months.  
   The bank calculates the final amount of the deposit taking into account the monthly accruals.  
   Use a for loop to calculate an amount including percentages. Let the contribution amount be of type float.
3. Write a program that prints the multiplication table to the console.  
- ### *Personal extra task:* 
   Modify your program (it will be enough to modify only one class to understand the principle)  
   so that your result does not depend on whether the letter is capital or small.
